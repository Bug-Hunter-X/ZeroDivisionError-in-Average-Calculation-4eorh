# ZeroDivisionError in Python Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Python: a `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when calculating the average of a list of numbers if the list is empty.  The code shows both the error and its solution.

The `bug.py` file contains the code with the error. The `bugSolution.py` file presents a corrected version that handles the edge case of an empty list gracefully.
